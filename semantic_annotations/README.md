# Semantic Annotations

The ```create_annotation_spreadsheet``` folder shows the steps needed to 1) create an annotation spreadsheet for the first time or 2) update an existing annotation spreadsheet with current package identifiers and attribute-level metadata. 

Once users have made a spreadsheet and assigned term IDs to attributes, the script and steps contained in the ```insert_semantic_annotations``` folder will automatically create the EML attribute annotation nodes and insert them into the appropriate EML documents. The output EML documents are edited copies of the original documents.

The ```archive``` folder contains old scripts that were used to test and develop the main semantic annotation scripts.
